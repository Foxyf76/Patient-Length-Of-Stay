# Patient-Length-Of-Stay
Data Mining Assignment 1 - Building a model to predict patient length of stay

This collection of Jupyter notebooks takes a large dataset pertaining the patient length of stay in Texas hospitals. After applying cleaning
and grouping of certain features from this dataset, a model is then built using information only available at the time of admission
(e.g. type of admission, age, race, day of admission etc.) to create a model that can predict the patient length of stay. 

This model is then improved by comparing the accuracy using classifiers available from SciKitLearn (e.g. KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier) along with hyper-parameter training and feature engineering to fine-tune the model for the most accurate predictions on how long said patient will stay in hospital.

Completed as part of Data Mining II assignment 1.
